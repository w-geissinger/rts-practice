# Getting Started with rts-practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is intended to serve as a practice playground. Do not commit anything such as passwords, usernames, email addresses, or any other personally identifying or otherwise sensitive information to this repository.

Some dependencies have already been installed to ease beginners into using dependencies that can change the ways in which you can use with React. TypeScript is one such example. Material UI has also been installed for easy aesthetic pages, as well as the emotion styles library as a dependency of MUI. 

## Dependency Documentation Links

[React-TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)

[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/) for quality pre-baked UI components

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/react) for easy styling


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. There is currently no test coverage in this repository.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
