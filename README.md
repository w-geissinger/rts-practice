# Getting Started with rts-practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is intended to serve as a practice playground. Do not commit anything such as passwords, usernames, email addresses, or any other personally identifying or otherwise sensitive information to this repository.

Some dependencies have already been installed to ease beginners into using dependencies that can change the ways in which you can use with React. TypeScript is one such example. Material UI has also been installed for easy aesthetic pages, as well as the emotion styles library as a dependency of MUI.
